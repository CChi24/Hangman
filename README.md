# Hangman

A fun, simple Hangman game that anybody can play!

## How Does it Work?

This Hangman is the typical "guess that word" game.
A user will be given a secret word chosen by the program at the beginning of the game.
The user has 6 tries to guess the secret word. The user will enter **ONE** letter at a time. 
As each guess is entered, the program will check that **ONLY LETTERS** are entered.

Each correct guess will be filled in, making the word more guessable each time.
Incorrect guesses will cause a part of the man to be drawn and the guess count to go down.
Hints are available to ease the confusion and, if it's too hard, a submission button is available to reveal the word automatically.

## Prerequisites
